/*
	We extend the set of real numbers into a non-Archimedian ordered field by adding infinitesimals.
	A positive infinitesimal number eps is smaller than any positive real number.
	The predicate a < b, where a and b are reals, is affected by adding infinitesimals in the following way:
	The test might become a + eps**2**i) < b + eps**2**j (a**b**c is shorthand notation for power (a, power (b,c))). 
	Assume without loss of generality that 0 < i <j.
	If a != b, then if a < b is true, then also a + eps**i < b + eps**j. Adding the infinitesimal didn't
	change the result. However, if a == b than the infinitisimals breaks the tie.
	So adding infinitesimals to a and b we need to change the predicate from (a < b) to (if a!=b ? a < b : i > j).
	
	Our simple implementation is the ExtendedReal with consists of the struct {double real; integer extension;}
	'extension' represent the infinitesimal power (eps, power (2,extension)).
	
	An ExtendedReal can be copied but should not be saved in a file.
