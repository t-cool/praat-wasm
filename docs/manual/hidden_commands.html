hidden commands

<p>Some commands in Praat's fixed and dynamic menus are hidden by default. You can still call hidden commands from scripts, run them by clicking on them in a <a href="ButtonEditor.html">ButtonEditor</a>, or make them visible with the help of the <a href="ButtonEditor.html">ButtonEditor</a>.</p>
<p>To hide commands that are visible by default, use the <a href="ButtonEditor.html">ButtonEditor</a>.</p>
<h2>What commands are hidden by default?</h2>
<p>Commands that are expected to be of very limited use, are hidden by default. Examples are:</p>
<dl>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">1. The commands <a href="Add_menu_command___.html">Add menu command...</a>, <b>Hide menu command...</b>, <b>Show menu command...</b>, <a href="Add_action_command___.html">Add action command...</a>, <b>Hide action command...</b>, and <b>Show action command...</b> in the <b>Praat</b> menu of the <a href="Objects_window.html">Objects window</a>. These are used in the <a href="buttons_file.html">buttons file</a> and could be used by an <a href="initialization_script.html">initialization script</a> or a <a href="plug-ins.html">plug-in</a> as well; in an interactive session, however, the functionality of these commands is part of the <a href="ScriptEditor.html">ScriptEditor</a> and the <a href="ButtonEditor.html">ButtonEditor</a>.</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">2. The command <b>Read from old Praat picture file...</b> in the <b>File</b> menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>. For reading a file format that was in use before May, 1995.</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">3. In the Praat program, the action <b>Sound: Save as Sesam file...</b>. Writes a file format in common use in the Netherlands on Vax machines. In the Dutch phonetics departments, the plugs were pulled from the Vaxes in 1994.</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">4. In the Praat program, the action <b>Sound: To Cochleagram (edb)...</b>. Needed by one person in 1994. An interesting, but undocumented procedure (De Boer's gammatone filter bank plus Meddis &amp; Hewitt's synapse model), which does not create a normally interpretable Cochleagram object.</dd>
