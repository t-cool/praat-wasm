pitch analysis by raw cross-correlation
</b></font></table></table>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>to perform a pitch analysis based on a cross-correlation method.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Raw cross-correlation is the pitch analysis method of choice if you want to do voice analysis (e.g. jitter, shimmer).</p>
<p>Note that the preferred method for speech (intonation, vocal fold vibration) is <a href="pitch_analysis_by_filtered_autocorrelation.html">pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation</a>. Raw cross-correlation is mainly for experimenting, or for applications where you need short time windows; for this latter reason, it is also the standard method for voice analysis.</p>
<p>See <a href="how_to_choose_a_pitch_analysis_method.html">how to choose a pitch analysis method</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>The algorithm performs an acoustic periodicity detection on the basis of a forward cross-correlation analysis.</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>Several settings are already described in <a href="Intro_4_2__Configuring_the_pitch_contour.html">Intro 4.2. Configuring the pitch contour</a>. The explanations below assume that you have gone through that part of the Intro.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Time step (s)</b> (standard value: 0.0)
<dd>the measurement interval (frame duration), in seconds. If you supply 0, Praat will use a time step of 0.25 / (<i>pitch floor</i>), e.g. 0.00333333 seconds if the pitch floor is 75 Hz; in this example, Praat computes 300 pitch values per second.</dd>
<dt><b>Pitch floor (Hz)</b> (standard value: 75 Hz)
<dd>candidates below this frequency will not be recruited. This parameter determines the length of the analysis window: it will be 1 longest period long, i.e., if the pitch floor is 75 Hz, the window will be 1/75 = 0.01333333 seconds long.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that if you set the time step to zero, the analysis windows for consecutive measurements will overlap appreciably: Praat will always compute 4 pitch values within one window length, i.e., the degree of <i>oversampling</i> is 4.</p>
<p>The other settings are the same as for <a href="pitch_analysis_by_raw_autocorrelation.html">pitch analysis by raw autocorrelation</a>.</p>
<h2>Availability in Praat</h2>
<p>Pitch analysis by raw cross-correlation is available in two ways in Praat:</p>
<dl>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; via <a href="Sound__To_Pitch__raw_cross-correlation____.html">Sound: To Pitch (raw cross-correlation)...</a> from the <b>Analyse periodicity</b> menu in the Objects window when you select a Sound object;</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; via <b>Show Pitch</b> and <b>Pitch analysis method is raw cross-correlation</b> from the <b>Pitch</b> menu when you are viewing a Sound or TextGrid object (<a href="SoundEditor.html">SoundEditor</a>, <a href="TextGridEditor.html">TextGridEditor</a>).</dd>
