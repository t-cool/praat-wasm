Sound: To TextGrid (silences)...
</b></font></table></table>
<p>A command that creates a <a href="TextGrid.html">TextGrid</a> in which the silent and sounding intervals of the selected <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> are marked.</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Silence threshold (dB)</b>
<dd>determines the maximum silence intensity value in dB with respect to the maximum intensity. For example, if <i>imax</i> is the maximum intensity in dB then the maximum silence intensity is calculated as <i>imax - silenceThreshold</i>; intervals with an intensity smaller than this value are considered as silent intervals.</dd>
<dt><b>Minimum silent interval (s)</b>
<dd>determines the minimum duration for an interval to be considered as silent. If you don't want the closure for a plosive to count as silent then use a large enough value.</dd>
<dt><b>Minimum sounding interval (s)</b>
<dd>determines the minimum duration for an interval to be <b>not</b> considered as silent. This offers the possibility to filter out small intense bursts of relatively short duration.</dd>
<dt><b>Silent interval label</b>
<dd>determines the label for a silent interval in the TextGrid.</dd>
<dt><b>Sounding interval label</b>
<dd>determines the label for a sounding interval in the TextGrid.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>First a copy of the sound is <a href="Sound__Filter__pass_Hann_band____.html">bandpass filtered</a> between 80 and 8000 Hz to remove especially the low frequency noise that can have a significant influence on the intensity measurement but does not really contribute to the sound. Next the <a href="Sound__To_Intensity___.html">intensity of the filtered sound</a> is determined. Finally the silent and sounding intervals are determined <a href="Intensity__To_TextGrid__silences____.html">from the intensity curve</a>.</p>
