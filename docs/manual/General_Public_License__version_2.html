<code>   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Version 2, June 1991 <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <br></code>
<code>   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br></code>
<code>   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Preamble<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the<br></code>
<code>   GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make<br></code>
<code>   sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br></code>
<code>   Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software<br></code>
<code>   Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your<br></code>
<code>   programs, too. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed<br></code>
<code>   to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you<br></code>
<code>   wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br></code>
<code>   in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to<br></code>
<code>   surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the<br></code>
<code>   software, or if you modify it. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients<br></code>
<code>   all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must<br></code>
<code>   show them these terms so they know their rights. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you<br></code>
<code>   legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no<br></code>
<code>   warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients<br></code>
<code>   to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the<br></code>
<code>   original authors' reputations. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that<br></code>
<code>   redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.<br></code>
<code>   To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at<br></code>
<code>   all. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND<br></code>
<code>   MODIFICATION<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder<br></code>
<code>   saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any<br></code>
<code>   such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work<br></code>
<code>   under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with<br></code>
<code>   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the<br></code>
<code>   term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its<br></code>
<code>   scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its<br></code>
<code>   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br></code>
<code>   Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,<br></code>
<code>   provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and<br></code>
<code>   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and<br></code>
<code>   give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty<br></code>
<code>   protection in exchange for a fee. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the<br></code>
<code>   Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that<br></code>
<code>   you also meet all of these conditions: <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>          a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the<br></code>
<code>          date of any change. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>          b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived<br></code>
<code>          from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the<br></code>
<code>          terms of this License. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>          c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when<br></code>
<code>          started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement<br></code>
<code>          including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you<br></code>
<code>          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the<br></code>
<code>          user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not<br></code>
<code>          normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an<br></code>
<code>          announcement.) <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived<br></code>
<code>   from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this<br></code>
<code>   License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br></code>
<code>   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole<br></code>
<code>   must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to<br></code>
<code>   each and every part regardless of who wrote it. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;<br></code>
<code>   rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the<br></code>
<code>   Program. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based<br></code>
<code>   on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope<br></code>
<code>   of this License. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable<br></code>
<code>   form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>          a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be<br></code>
<code>          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software<br></code>
<code>          interchange; or, <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>          b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no<br></code>
<code>          more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the<br></code>
<code>          corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br></code>
<code>          customarily used for software interchange; or, <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>          c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.<br></code>
<code>          (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in<br></code>
<code>          object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an<br></code>
<code>   executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br></code>
<code>   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as<br></code>
<code>   a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either<br></code>
<code>   source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which<br></code>
<code>   the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then<br></code>
<code>   offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,<br></code>
<code>   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this<br></code>
<code>   License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will<br></code>
<code>   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from<br></code>
<code>   you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you<br></code>
<code>   permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you<br></code>
<code>   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br></code>
<code>   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,<br></code>
<code>   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically<br></code>
<code>   receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and<br></code>
<code>   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br></code>
<code>   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not<br></code>
<code>   limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that<br></code>
<code>   contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br></code>
<code>   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,<br></code>
<code>   then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit<br></code>
<code>   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br></code>
<code>   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the<br></code>
<code>   Program. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the<br></code>
<code>   section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to<br></code>
<code>   contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software<br></code>
<code>   distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous<br></code>
<code>   contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of<br></code>
<code>   that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other<br></code>
<code>   system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted<br></code>
<code>   interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit<br></code>
<code>   geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br></code>
<code>   countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this<br></code>
<code>   License. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from<br></code>
<code>   time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address<br></code>
<code>   new problems or concerns. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License<br></code>
<code>   which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that<br></code>
<code>   version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a<br></code>
<code>   version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are<br></code>
<code>   different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software<br></code>
<code>   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be<br></code>
<code>   guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the<br></code>
<code>   sharing and reuse of software generally. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   NO WARRANTY<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE<br></code>
<code>   PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE<br></code>
<code>   STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE<br></code>
<code>   PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,<br></code>
<code>   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND<br></code>
<code>   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br></code>
<code>   PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,<br></code>
<code>   YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL<br></code>
<code>   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE<br></code>
<code>   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br></code>
<code>   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR<br></code>
<code>   INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA<br></code>
<code>   BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br></code>
<code>   FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH<br></code>
<code>   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to<br></code>
<code>   achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to<br></code>
<code>   most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a<br></code>
<code>   pointer to where the full notice is found. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.<br></code>
<code>   Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br></code>
<code>   modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License<br></code>
<code>   as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2<br></code>
<code>   of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br></code>
<code>   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br></code>
<code>   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br></code>
<code>   GNU General Public License for more details.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br></code>
<code>   along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br></code>
<code>   Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br></code>
<code>   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details<br></code>
<code>   type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome<br></code>
<code>   to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' <br></code>
<code>   for details.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public<br></code>
<code>   License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could<br></code>
<code>   even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright<br></code>
<code>   disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: <br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright<br></code>
<code>   interest in the program `Gnomovision'<br></code>
<code>   (which makes passes at compilers) written <br></code>

<code>   <br></code>
<code>   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br></code>
<code>   Ty Coon, President of Vice<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your<br></code>
<code>   program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br></code>
<code>   the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License. <br></code>
