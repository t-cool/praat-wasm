pitch analysis by filtered cross-correlation

<p>A command that creates a <a href="Pitch.html">Pitch</a> object from every selected <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>to perform a pitch analysis based on the forward cross-correlation of the low-pass filtered signal.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>We know of no situation yet in which this method is preferred over <a href="pitch_analysis_by_filtered_autocorrelation.html">pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation</a> (which seems better for measuring intonation and vocal-fold vibration frequency), <a href="pitch_analysis_by_raw_cross-correlation.html">pitch analysis by raw cross-correlation</a> (which is definitely better for voice analysis, such as jitter and shimmer), or <a href="pitch_analysis_by_raw_autocorrelation.html">pitch analysis by raw autocorrelation</a> (which is better for determining raw periodicity). It is possible that filtered cross-correlation can play a role in voice analysis in the future, in combination with one of the other methods; this is yet to be determined.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>This command will first low-pass filter the signal, then apply <a href="pitch_analysis_by_raw_cross-correlation.html">pitch analysis by raw cross-correlation</a> on the filtered signal. For the filter function, see <a href="pitch_analysis_by_filtered_autocorrelation.html">pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation</a>.</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The settings are the same as for <a href="pitch_analysis_by_filtered_autocorrelation.html">pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation</a>.</p>
<h2>Availability in Praat</h2>
<p>Pitch analysis by raw cross-correlation is available in two ways in Praat:</p>
<dl>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; via <a href="Sound__To_Pitch__raw_cross-correlation____.html">Sound: To Pitch (raw cross-correlation)...</a> from the <b>Analyse periodicity</b> menu in the Objects window when you select a Sound object;</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; via <b>Show Pitch</b> and <b>Pitch analysis method is raw cross-correlation</b> from the <b>Pitch</b> menu when you are viewing a Sound or TextGrid object (<a href="SoundEditor.html">SoundEditor</a>, <a href="TextGridEditor.html">TextGridEditor</a>).</dd>
