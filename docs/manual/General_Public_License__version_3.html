<code>                       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br></code>
<code>                          Version 3, 29 June 2007<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;<br></code>
<code>    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br></code>
<code>    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>                               Preamble<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br></code>
<code>   software and other kinds of works.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br></code>
<code>   to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br></code>
<code>   the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br></code>
<code>   share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br></code>
<code>   software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br></code>
<code>   GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br></code>
<code>   any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br></code>
<code>   your programs, too.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br></code>
<code>   price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br></code>
<code>   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br></code>
<code>   them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br></code>
<code>   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br></code>
<code>   free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br></code>
<code>   these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br></code>
<code>   certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br></code>
<code>   you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br></code>
<code>   gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br></code>
<code>   freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br></code>
<code>   or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br></code>
<code>   know their rights.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br></code>
<code>   (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br></code>
<code>   giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br></code>
<code>   that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br></code>
<code>   authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br></code>
<code>   changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br></code>
<code>   authors of previous versions.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br></code>
<code>   modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br></code>
<code>   can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br></code>
<code>   protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br></code>
<code>   pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br></code>
<code>   use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br></code>
<code>   have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br></code>
<code>   products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br></code>
<code>   stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br></code>
<code>   of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br></code>
<code>   States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br></code>
<code>   software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br></code>
<code>   avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br></code>
<code>   make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br></code>
<code>   patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br></code>
<code>   modification follow.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     0. Definitions.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br></code>
<code>   works, such as semiconductor masks.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br></code>
<code>   License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br></code>
<code>   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br></code>
<code>   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br></code>
<code>   exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br></code>
<code>   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br></code>
<code>   on the Program.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br></code>
<code>   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br></code>
<code>   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br></code>
<code>   computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br></code>
<code>   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br></code>
<code>   public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br></code>
<code>   parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br></code>
<code>   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br></code>
<code>   to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br></code>
<code>   feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br></code>
<code>   tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br></code>
<code>   extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br></code>
<code>   work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br></code>
<code>   the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br></code>
<code>   menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     1. Source Code.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br></code>
<code>   for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br></code>
<code>   form of a work.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br></code>
<code>   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br></code>
<code>   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br></code>
<code>   is widely used among developers working in that language.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br></code>
<code>   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br></code>
<code>   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br></code>
<code>   Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br></code>
<code>   Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br></code>
<code>   implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br></code>
<code>   "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br></code>
<code>   (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br></code>
<code>   (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br></code>
<code>   produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br></code>
<code>   the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br></code>
<code>   work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br></code>
<code>   control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br></code>
<code>   System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br></code>
<code>   programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br></code>
<code>   which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br></code>
<code>   includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br></code>
<code>   the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br></code>
<code>   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br></code>
<code>   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br></code>
<code>   subprograms and other parts of the work.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br></code>
<code>   can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br></code>
<code>   Source.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br></code>
<code>   same work.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     2. Basic Permissions.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br></code>
<code>   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br></code>
<code>   conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br></code>
<code>   permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br></code>
<code>   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br></code>
<code>   content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br></code>
<code>   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br></code>
<code>   convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br></code>
<code>   in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br></code>
<code>   of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br></code>
<code>   with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br></code>
<code>   the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br></code>
<code>   not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br></code>
<code>   for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br></code>
<code>   and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br></code>
<code>   your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br></code>
<code>   the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br></code>
<code>   makes it unnecessary.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br></code>
<code>   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br></code>
<code>   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br></code>
<code>   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br></code>
<code>   measures.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br></code>
<code>   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br></code>
<code>   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br></code>
<code>   the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br></code>
<code>   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br></code>
<code>   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br></code>
<code>   technological measures.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br></code>
<code>   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br></code>
<code>   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br></code>
<code>   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br></code>
<code>   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br></code>
<code>   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br></code>
<code>   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br></code>
<code>   and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br></code>
<code>   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br></code>
<code>   terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br></code>
<code>       it, and giving a relevant date.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br></code>
<code>       released under this License and any conditions added under section<br></code>
<code>       7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br></code>
<code>       "keep intact all notices".<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br></code>
<code>       License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br></code>
<code>       License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br></code>
<code>       additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br></code>
<code>       regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br></code>
<code>       permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br></code>
<code>       invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br></code>
<code>       Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br></code>
<code>       interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br></code>
<code>       work need not make them do so.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br></code>
<code>   works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br></code>
<code>   and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br></code>
<code>   in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br></code>
<code>   "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br></code>
<code>   used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br></code>
<code>   beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br></code>
<code>   in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br></code>
<code>   parts of the aggregate.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br></code>
<code>   of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br></code>
<code>   machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br></code>
<code>   in one of these ways:<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br></code>
<code>       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br></code>
<code>       Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br></code>
<code>       customarily used for software interchange.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br></code>
<code>       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br></code>
<code>       written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br></code>
<code>       long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br></code>
<code>       model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br></code>
<code>       copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br></code>
<code>       product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br></code>
<code>       medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br></code>
<code>       more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br></code>
<code>       conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br></code>
<code>       Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br></code>
<code>       written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br></code>
<code>       alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br></code>
<code>       only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br></code>
<code>       with subsection 6b.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br></code>
<code>       place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br></code>
<code>       Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br></code>
<code>       further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br></code>
<code>       Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br></code>
<code>       copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br></code>
<code>       may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br></code>
<code>       that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br></code>
<code>       clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br></code>
<code>       Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br></code>
<code>       Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br></code>
<code>       available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br></code>
<code>       you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br></code>
<code>       Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br></code>
<code>       charge under subsection 6d.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br></code>
<code>   from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br></code>
<code>   included in conveying the object code work.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br></code>
<code>   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br></code>
<code>   or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br></code>
<code>   into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br></code>
<code>   doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br></code>
<code>   product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br></code>
<code>   typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br></code>
<code>   of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br></code>
<code>   actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br></code>
<code>   is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br></code>
<code>   commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br></code>
<code>   the only significant mode of use of the product.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br></code>
<code>   procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br></code>
<code>   and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br></code>
<code>   a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br></code>
<code>   suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br></code>
<code>   code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br></code>
<code>   modification has been made.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br></code>
<code>   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br></code>
<code>   part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br></code>
<code>   User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br></code>
<code>   fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br></code>
<code>   Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br></code>
<code>   by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br></code>
<code>   if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br></code>
<code>   modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br></code>
<code>   been installed in ROM).<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br></code>
<code>   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br></code>
<code>   for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br></code>
<code>   the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br></code>
<code>   network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br></code>
<code>   adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br></code>
<code>   protocols for communication across the network.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br></code>
<code>   in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br></code>
<code>   documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br></code>
<code>   source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br></code>
<code>   unpacking, reading or copying.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     7. Additional Terms.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br></code>
<code>   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br></code>
<code>   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br></code>
<code>   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br></code>
<code>   that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br></code>
<code>   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br></code>
<code>   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br></code>
<code>   this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br></code>
<code>   remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br></code>
<code>   it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br></code>
<code>   removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br></code>
<code>   additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br></code>
<code>   for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br></code>
<code>   add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br></code>
<code>   that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br></code>
<code>       terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br></code>
<code>       author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br></code>
<code>       Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br></code>
<code>       requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br></code>
<code>       reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br></code>
<code>       authors of the material; or<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br></code>
<code>       trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br></code>
<code>       material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br></code>
<code>       it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br></code>
<code>       any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br></code>
<code>       those licensors and authors.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br></code>
<code>   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br></code>
<code>   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br></code>
<code>   governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br></code>
<code>   restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br></code>
<code>   a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br></code>
<code>   License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br></code>
<code>   of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br></code>
<code>   not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br></code>
<code>   must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br></code>
<code>   additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br></code>
<code>   where to find the applicable terms.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br></code>
<code>   form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br></code>
<code>   the above requirements apply either way.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     8. Termination.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br></code>
<code>   provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br></code>
<code>   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br></code>
<code>   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br></code>
<code>   paragraph of section 11).<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br></code>
<code>   license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br></code>
<code>   provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br></code>
<code>   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br></code>
<code>   holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br></code>
<code>   prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br></code>
<code>   reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br></code>
<code>   violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br></code>
<code>   received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br></code>
<code>   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br></code>
<code>   your receipt of the notice.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br></code>
<code>   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br></code>
<code>   this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br></code>
<code>   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br></code>
<code>   material under section 10.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br></code>
<code>   run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br></code>
<code>   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br></code>
<code>   to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br></code>
<code>   nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br></code>
<code>   modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br></code>
<code>   not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br></code>
<code>   covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br></code>
<code>   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br></code>
<code>   propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br></code>
<code>   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br></code>
<code>   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br></code>
<code>   organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br></code>
<code>   work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br></code>
<code>   transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br></code>
<code>   licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br></code>
<code>   give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br></code>
<code>   Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br></code>
<code>   the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br></code>
<code>   rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br></code>
<code>   not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br></code>
<code>   rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br></code>
<code>   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br></code>
<code>   any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br></code>
<code>   sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     11. Patents.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br></code>
<code>   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br></code>
<code>   work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br></code>
<code>   owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br></code>
<code>   hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br></code>
<code>   by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br></code>
<code>   but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br></code>
<code>   consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br></code>
<code>   purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br></code>
<code>   patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br></code>
<code>   this License.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br></code>
<code>   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br></code>
<code>   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br></code>
<code>   propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br></code>
<code>   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br></code>
<code>   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br></code>
<code>   sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br></code>
<code>   party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br></code>
<code>   patent against the party.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br></code>
<code>   and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br></code>
<code>   to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br></code>
<code>   publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br></code>
<code>   then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br></code>
<code>   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br></code>
<code>   patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br></code>
<code>   consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br></code>
<code>   license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br></code>
<code>   actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br></code>
<code>   covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br></code>
<code>   in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br></code>
<code>   country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br></code>
<code>   arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br></code>
<code>   covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br></code>
<code>   receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br></code>
<code>   or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br></code>
<code>   you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br></code>
<code>   work and works based on it.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br></code>
<code>   the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br></code>
<code>   conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br></code>
<code>   specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br></code>
<code>   work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br></code>
<code>   in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br></code>
<code>   to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br></code>
<code>   the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br></code>
<code>   parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br></code>
<code>   patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br></code>
<code>   conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br></code>
<code>   for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br></code>
<code>   contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br></code>
<code>   or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br></code>
<code>   any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br></code>
<code>   otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br></code>
<code>   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br></code>
<code>   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br></code>
<code>   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br></code>
<code>   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br></code>
<code>   not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br></code>
<code>   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br></code>
<code>   the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br></code>
<code>   License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br></code>
<code>   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br></code>
<code>   under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br></code>
<code>   combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br></code>
<code>   License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br></code>
<code>   but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br></code>
<code>   section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br></code>
<code>   combination as such.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     14. Revised Versions of this License.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br></code>
<code>   the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br></code>
<code>   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br></code>
<code>   address new problems or concerns.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br></code>
<code>   Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br></code>
<code>   Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br></code>
<code>   option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br></code>
<code>   version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br></code>
<code>   Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br></code>
<code>   GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br></code>
<code>   by the Free Software Foundation.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br></code>
<code>   versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br></code>
<code>   public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br></code>
<code>   to choose that version for the Program.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     Later license versions may give you additional or different<br></code>
<code>   permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br></code>
<code>   author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br></code>
<code>   later version.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br></code>
<code>   APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br></code>
<code>   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br></code>
<code>   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br></code>
<code>   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br></code>
<code>   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br></code>
<code>   IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br></code>
<code>   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     16. Limitation of Liability.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br></code>
<code>   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br></code>
<code>   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br></code>
<code>   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br></code>
<code>   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br></code>
<code>   DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br></code>
<code>   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br></code>
<code>   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br></code>
<code>   SUCH DAMAGES.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br></code>
<code>   above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br></code>
<code>   reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br></code>
<code>   an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br></code>
<code>   Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br></code>
<code>   copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br></code>
<code>   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br></code>
<code>   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br></code>
<code>   to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br></code>
<code>   state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br></code>
<code>   the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br></code>
<code>       Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br></code>
<code>       it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br></code>
<code>       the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br></code>
<code>       (at your option) any later version.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br></code>
<code>       but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br></code>
<code>       MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br></code>
<code>       GNU General Public License for more details.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br></code>
<code>       along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br></code>
<code>   notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>       &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br></code>
<code>       This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br></code>
<code>       This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br></code>
<code>       under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br></code>
<code>   parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br></code>
<code>   might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br></code>
<code>   if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br></code>
<code>   For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br></code>
<code>   &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br></code>
<code>   <br></code>
<code>     The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br></code>
<code>   into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br></code>
<code>   may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br></code>
<code>   the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br></code>
<code>   Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br></code>
