Independent Component Analysis on EEG
</b></font></table></table>
<p>Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is often used to improve <a href="EEG.html">EEG</a> signals. See <a href="blind_source_separation.html">blind source separation</a> for the algorithm.</p>
<h2>1. Selecting your channels</h2>
<p>You typically will not want to do ICA on all 80 channels of your signal, some of which may not even be EEG channels. To create a smaller EEG with e.g. only the 64 scalp channels, use <b>EEG: Extract channels...</b>. From here on we will assume that your reduced EEG has 64 channels.</p>
<h2>2. How to get a MixingMatrix</h2>
<p>Once you have your reduced EEG, you can start to do ICA on it. This starts by creating a <a href="MixingMatrix.html">MixingMatrix</a>: select your EEG object and choose <b>To MixingMatrix...</b>. The resulting MixingMatrix has one row for each of your 64 EEG channels, and columns called &#8220;ic1&#8221; through &#8220;ic64&#8221;.</p>
<h2>3. How to see the independent components</h2>
<p>Select your EEG and your MixingMatrix together and choose <b>Unmix</b>. The resulting ICA-EEG will have 64 channels called &#8220;ic1&#8221; through &#8220;ic64&#8221;.</p>
<h2>4. Just checking back</h2>
<p>If you select your ICA-EEG together with your MixingMatrix and choose <b>Mix</b>, the resulting EEG should be very similar to your original 64-channel EEG.</p>
