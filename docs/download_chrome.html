Downloading Praat for Chromebook
</b></font></table></table>

<p><b>WARNING: A Chromebook is not a full-fledged desktop computer;
Praat may more or less run, but some things may go wrong.
The same goes for other programs that you may need as a phonetician,
such as the program R for statistics (e.g. in November 2021,
a random undefined variable prevented lme4 from installing from source).
If you can avoid it, do not use a Chromebook for your studies or research.</b></p>

<hr><h3>1. Praat on a Chromebook? First install Linux</h3>
<p>You can install Praat on several types of Chromebooks, though probably not on all.
We do not (yet?) provide an Android edition of Praat,
which, if it existed, you would be able to install via Google Play.
What we do provide are various Linux editions of Praat.</p>
<p>To install Praat-for-Linux on your Chromebook, you first have to make sure
that Linux has been installed: click on the right bottom of your screen,
then on the Settings wheel, then <b>Advanced</b>, then <b>Developers</b>,
then scroll down to <b>Linux</b> and click on the triangle.
If you see a button <b>Remove</b> or <b>Uninstall</b>,
then Linux was apparently already installed. If instead you see a button <b>Install</b>,
then click that and wait until Linux has been installed.</b>
<p>If Linux is installed correctly, a folder called <b>Linux files</b>
should appear in your <b>Files</b> window. To see the Files window,
click your Launcher (bottom left of your screen), then click on the up arrow,
then click on <b>Files</b>. Under <b>My files</b>, you should then see the folder
<b>Linux files</b>.</p>

<hr><h3>2. The easiest installation of the latest Praat version on an Intel64 or ARM64 computer</h3>
<p>Once Linux has been installed, click on the <b>Launcher</b>
(bottom left of your screen) and type <b>Terminal</b>.
You see a Terminal window on you screen, showing a prompt like</p>
<code>
yourname@penguin:~$
</code>
<p>The Terminal window is an app for typing Linux commands, and to install Praat you will
have to type some Linux commands into this Terminal window. The first thing to get to know
is the type of processor that your computer has. After the penguin prompt, you type</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uname -a
</code>
<p>(which stands for something like “give me all of the system name”),
followed by pressing the Enter key.
You should get an answer similar to what I got on my 2019 HP Chromebook:</p>
<code>
Linux penguin 4.19.69-06666-gfkhsdgfh #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Sep 6 22:15:24 PDT 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux
</code>
<p>In this example, the next-to-last word is <b>x86_64</b>,
which means that my HP Chromebook is powered by an Intel64 (i.e. 64-bit Intel) processor.
If you also see <b>x86_64</b> on <i>your</i> Chromebook, then you are lucky,
because a Linux edition for Intel64 processors is available from
the download page that you are reading now. Here it is:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b><a href="https://github.com/praat/praat/releases/download/v6.4.44a/praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar.gz">praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar.gz</a></b> (25 September 2025; 26.1 MB)
</dl>
<p>If the next-to-last word is <b>aarch64</b> instead,
this means that your Chromebook is powered by an ARM64 (i.e. 64-bit ARM) processor.
Again, you are lucky, because a Linux edition for ARM64 processors is also available:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b><a href="https://github.com/praat/praat/releases/download/v6.4.44a/praat6444_chrome-arm64.tar.gz">praat6444_chrome-arm64.tar.gz</a></b> (25 September 2025; 24.9 MB)
</dl>

<p>When you download one of these two files, it will appear in your <b>Downloads</b> folder,
which is another folder under <b>My files</b> (if the file doesn’t download when you click on it,
then try right-click and choose <b>Save link as...</b> in your browser).</p>

<p>Once the file praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar.gz or praat6444_chrome-arm64.tar.gz
is in your <b>Downloads</b> folder, drag it from your <b>Downloads</b> folder to your <b>Linux files</b> folder.</p>

<p>After you confirm that your <b>Linux files</b> folder contains praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar.gz (or its ARM64 friend),
you are ready to install Praat via the Terminal. Thus, open your Terminal app again and type:</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ls -al
</code>
<p>which stands for something like “list all files”. After you press the Enter key,
the resulting list shows a number of hidden files, with names that start with “.”,
but it should also show you the file that you downloaded, probably in a line like this:</p>
<code>
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 14764270 Nov  7 09:52 praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar.gz
</code>
<p>Here, 14764270 is the size of the file in bytes (i.e., the file is 14.7 MB big), “Nov 7 09:52” is the date and time
at which the file was created (i.e. downloaded or copied), and “yourname” is the name
of the owner of the file, i.e. you.</p>
<p>This file is not yet the Praat app. The extension <b>.gz</b> means that the file
has been compressed by <b>gzip</b>,
so you have to uncompress it by typing the following command into the Terminal window
(i.e. type the text, followed by Enter):</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gunzip praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar.gz
</code>
<p>After this command, do</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ls -al
</code>
<p>again, and you see that the file has been unpacked to something that is 55.2 MB big:</p>
<code>
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 55200000 Jan &nbsp;3 00:51 praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar
</code>
<p>This file is still not the Praat app. The extension <b>.tar</b> means that the file
has been archived by <b>tar</b>,
so you have to unpack it again with the following command:</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tar xvf praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar
</code>
<p>where <b> xvf</b> stands for eXtract - Verbose - File. After this command, do</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ls -al
</code>
<p>again, and you see that finally a file called <b>praat</b> has been created
(the <b>tar</b> is also still there; you can also see both files
in the <b>Linux files</b> folder):</p>
<code>
-rwxr-xr-x 1 yourname yourname 55235168 Jan &nbsp;3 00:51 praat<br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 55200000 Jan &nbsp;3 00:51 praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar
</code>
<p>You see that the file <b>praat</b> has the date and time at which it was originally
created by the authors of Praat. The three little <i>x</i>es in <b>-rwxr-xr-x</b> mean
that the file <b>praat</b> is executable, so you can now type</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./praat
</code>
<p>and Praat should show up with its Objects window and its Picture window.
You may have to try to put a Help window on the screen to turn the mouse cursor
from something invisible into a cross.
If you use Praat for the first time, choose <b>Intro</b> from the Help menu.</p>

<p>In case you wonder where you are, try the command</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pwd
</code>
<p>which means something like “Print Working Directory”. The answer will be something like</p>
<code>
/home/yourname
</code>
<p>This is the name by which the <b>Linux files</b> folder is known to Linux!
So they are the same folder, known under two different names,
depending on whether you look from the ChromeOS side or from the Linux side.</p>
<p>You no longer need the file praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar. You can throw it away by typing</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rm praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar
</code>
<p>where <code>rm</code> stands for “remove”.</p>

<p>(If your processor is ARM64, then replace “intel64” with “arm64” in all places above.)</p>

<hr><h3>3. What can go wrong?</h3>
<p><b>3a. If you do not see the <i>x</i>es</b></p>
<p>If instead of</p>
<code>
-rwxr-xr-x 1 yourname yourname 55235168 Jan &nbsp;3 00:51 praat<br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 55200000 Jan &nbsp;3 00:51 praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar
</code>
<p>you see</p>
<code>
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 55235168 Jan &nbsp;3 00:51 praat<br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 55200000 Jan &nbsp;3 00:51 praat6444_chrome-intel64.tar
</code>
<p>then the file <b>praat</b> is not executable, i.e. the command</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./praat
</code>
<p>gives you an error message. This situation can happen if you change the above procedure,
for instance if you unpack Praat in the <b>Downloads</b> folder or
in a folder under <b>Google Drive</b>. This is because ChromeOS wants to protect you against
unknowingly putting programs (e.g. viruses) on your computer: any file you download is
made non-executable by removing the <i>x</i>es. Only the Linux part of your computer does not
have this protection, which is why you can install Praat under <b>Linux files</b>.</p>
<p>If you do end up with a non-executable <b>praat</b> in your Linux folder,
you can make it executable by typing</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chmod ugo+x praat
</code>
<p>(which stands for “CHange the MODe for User, Group and World to eXecutable”)
into your Terminal, and confirm that you got three <i>x</i>es.</p>

<p><b>3b. If Praat complains that some libraries (dependencies) are not found</b></p>
<p>The correct installation of Praat relies on the presence of several software
libraries, which may or may not be present on your computer. If Praat complains
that something is missing, then you can try to install some additional
components with the following commands:</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install gtk-3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install libasound2 libasound2-plugins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install pulseaudio<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install gtk+-2.0 &nbsp; (if you install version 6.1.16; see below under 9)
</code>
<p>and then try to start Praat again (please notify us if anything is still missing).</p>

<p>(If your processor is ARM64, then replace “intel64” with “arm64” in all places above.)</p>

<hr><h3>4. How to start Praat the second time</h3>
<p>After installation and the first run have succeeded, then the next time
you only have to start your Terminal and type</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./praat
</code>

<hr><h3>5. Installing other Chromebook editions (under Linux)</h3>
<p>If you do not have a 64-bit Intel processor,
you can still probably install Praat, by typing</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install praat
</code>
<p>into your Linux terminal. At the moment of writing (November 3, 2021),
this will give you Praat version 6.0.48 (February 17, 2019).</p>
<p>If you want a newer version,
you can get that from <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/praat">Debian</a>
or <a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/praat">Debian</a>.
Recent upstream versions of the Praat package backported to the stable
and testing distributions of Debian are available in an
<a href="http://praat.cefala.org">APT repository</a>.
These methods are probably for experts only.</p>

<hr><h3>6. Phonetic symbols</h3>
<p>If you want to see good phonetic characters,
it is best to install the Charis SIL and the Doulos SIL font:</p>

<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install fonts-sil-charis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install fonts-sil-doulos
</code>

<hr><h3>7. Running Praat from the command line</h3>
<p>To run Praat from a terminal window,
write a Praat script and specify that script on the command line, optionally with arguments, e.g.:</p>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praat --run playsinewave.praat 377 0.9</code>
<p>For details see <a href="manual/Scripting_6_9__Calling_from_the_command_line.html">Calling from the command line</a> in the Scripting manual.</p>

<hr><h3>8. Known possible problems, and their solution</h3>
<p><b>8a. Sound recording</b></p>
<p>Linux for Chromebook does support the microphone,
but you will have to switch the microphone on in the Linux settings.</p>
<p>If, when recording, you get a message about an unsupported sample rate,
try 48000 Hz instead of 44100 Hz.</p>
<p>If your recorded sound sounds all jittery and creaky,
try select the “sysdefault” microphone (in Praat’s recording window),
or perhaps the “default” microphone, and perhaps try both 44100 and 48000 Hz for the sample rate.</p>
<p><b>8b. Window titles</b></p>
<p>On Windows, Linux and the Mac you will see a window’s or dialog’s title
in its title bar, e.g. “Create Sound from formula” or “1. Sound sineWithNoise”.
ChromeOS refuses to show window titles,
<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=918314">probably on purpose</a>.
Praat therefore tries to include an underlined bold text below the title bar.
Once your windows start to show their titles twice, this will mean
that the ChromeOS people decided to show window titles after all,
and you are invited to notify the authors of Praat of this,
so that they can remove their “surrogate window title label widget”.</p>
<p><b>8c. Running cursor</b></p>
<p>If the cursor does not run when you are playing a sound in the Sound window,
you may want to start up Praat with X11 instead of Wayland:</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GDK_BACKEND=x11 ./praat
</code>

<hr><h3>9. Older editions of Praat</h3>
<p>If your Praat windows look strange, try <a href="https://github.com/praat/praat/releases/download/v6.1.16/praat6116_chrome64.tar.gz">praat6116_chrome64.tar.gz</a> of 6 June 2020.</p>
