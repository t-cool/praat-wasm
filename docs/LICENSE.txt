are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0:

License for the Praat manual pages (in `docs/manual`)
======================================================

The `docs/manual` folder contains a copy of the manual pages of the Praat application,
i.e. of both the HTML files and their included pictures (PNG files).
These pages are also available in the Praat program under Help,
The versions on the website were generated from Praat with the menu command
**Save manual to HTML folder...**. As the source of these manual pages is the Praat source code,
all HTML and PNG files in `docs/manual` are licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later:

GNU General Public License v3.0 or later
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html


Third-party files included in `docs/`
=====================================

The following five files by third parties are included on the Praat download pages,
but are not covered by the above licenses. We redistribute them unchanged under their original licenses:

Screen captures included in `docs/pictures`
===========================================

The following files in `docs/pictures` are screen captures of Microsoft Windows Settings
or Microsoft Windows error messages, perhaps edited with a red ellipse or arrow,
and perhaps with blurring of private information (such as user names).
The ellipses and arrows were added by the Praat team.

- arm64.png
- dontrun.png
- intel64.png
- unblock.png

The underlying screen captures are copyrighted Microsoft Corporation,
and we included these files in the Praat download pages solely
in order to support the user in downloading and/or installing Praat.
The Praat team believes that this usage of Microsoft content falls under fair use.

The other files in `docs/pictures`, namely the Praat icons and Paul's and David's portraits,
are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.
