			the retainCount of the cocoaTextView will quickly rise,
			as shown by running the following script:
				for i to 1e6
					writeInfoLine: i
				endfor
			and waiting for Praat to crash after taking 3 GB of memory (macOS 10.15).
			Also, if you stop before crashing (e.g. have the loop run to only 1e5),
			then much of the memory will not be released at all.
