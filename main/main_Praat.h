/*
	These things have to be #defines so that they can be used not only in main_Praat.cpp when initializing the app,
	but also in an automated `praat.plist` (for macOS).
	To achieve this automation, go to `Build Settings` -> `Packaging` in the Praat Xcode project,
	and then set `Preprocess Info.plist File` to `Yes`
	and `Info.plist Preprocessor Prefix File` to `main/main_Praat.h`.
